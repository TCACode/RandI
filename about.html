<h1>All About Us</h1>
<p class="bob">
    At the young age of 16 Bobby started a job at a distribution plant in Bartlett, TN where he worked his way up to the Distribution manager. After 25 years of service the plant took a fall when the economy began a downward spiral. He then took another job with a trucking company which then made a change that left him again without a job. He then took a job with another trucking company that soon left Jackson as well. Here Bobby was again facing the job market that had very little jobs. Bobby then decided that he wanted to do something he loved. He was giving all he had to these companies and was still left unemployed.  Bobby and his wife prayed for direction for their next journey they were about to embark upon. With lots and lots of prayer, tears, and faith Bobby's Detailing Service was started. The Lord was right there through the whole process of starting this new business. Bobby would detail vehicles in his garage during the day while also watching his daughter. He and his wife would then work together detailing vehicles at night after she would finish her day job.
