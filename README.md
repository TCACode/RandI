Bobbys detail service 
The company I created a website for is Bobby's Detailing Service. They wash all sorts of cars, trucks, and so much more. It is a small business in Jackson.
The colors go along with the logo for Bobby's Detailing.
The client wanted a very clean and crisp look to the website. 
I went off trying to make it look very clean and organized. That is why the background is  gray. The gray ties all the colors together therefore making it look crisp.
